* [Supplementary data from the original paper](https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/nature/journal/v477/n7365/extref/nature10414-s1.pdf)

* [Website with the data from the study](http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mus/www/19genomes/index.html)

* This study formed part of the [Arabidopsis 1000 genomes Project](http://1001genomes.org/index.html)


**Objectives**

* Align RNA-Seq reads from seedling material of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Columbia and Landsberg erecta with the STAR splice-aware aligner

* Call SNPs with Freebayes and filter the SNPs

* Annotate SNP calls with snpEff to indicate whether the SNP changes are functionally significant e.g. produce a stop codon

<br>

**Inputs**

* Location of fastq reads: /var/scratch/baileyp/Practical\_2\_Arabidopsis\_accns/fastq_files

* fastq read file for Columbia (Col_0): R38\_L1\_Col\_0\_sdlg\_R1\_nss\_barcode\_GTA.fastq
(78 base pair reads)

* fastq read file for Landberg erecta (Ler_0): R38\_L3\_Ler\_0\_sdlg\_R1\_nss\_barcode\_TGC.fastq
 (78 base pair reads)

* Location of the Arabidopsis genome reference and GTF file:
	/var/scratch/baileyp/Practical\_2\_Arabidopsis_accns/genome\_reference

* Reference: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa

* GTF file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.39.gtf

<br>
**Packages to load**

```sh
module load star/2.5.2b
module load trimmomatic/0.38
module load samtools/1.8
```
<br>

**Step 1 - Index the Arabidopsis reference with STAR**

* [The STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf)

* First, copy over the Arabidopsis reference to your working directory:

```sh
cp /var/scratch/baileyp/Practical\_2\_Arabidopsis_accns/genome\_reference/ .
```

* Now index the reference. Before running, adjust the code so that STAR uses four cpus instead of one. Also adjust the sjdbOverhang parameter according to the manual instructions. 100 will not  produce an index with this data set!

```sh
STAR --runThreadN 1 \
--runMode  genomeGenerate \
--genomeDir  ./ \
--genomeFastaFiles  Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa \
--sjdbGTFfile  Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.39.gtf \
--sjdbOverhang 100
```

<br>
**Step 2 - Prepare the reads for aligning to the  reference**

* **Note:** The FreeBayes SNP caller requires that the Phred sequence quality scores are Phred+33 but in this data set these reads were processed with the Illumnina v1.6 pipeline which outputs reads with Phred+64 scores.

* For more information on phred scores, see [the fastq format Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format)

* Therefore we need to convert these fastq records from Phred+64 to Phred+33.

* Amazinghly, the Wiki page tells you how to convert the scores, like this:
 
```sh
sed -e '4~4y/@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghi/!"#$%&'\''()*+,-.\/0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJ/' \
/var/scratch/baileyp/Practical_2_Arabidopsis_accns/fastq_files/R38_L1_Col_0_sdlg_R1_nss_barcode_GTA.fastq \
> Col_0_R1_Phred33.fastq
```

* Use the above command to convert the phred scores in both the Col\_0 and Ler\_0 fastq files and give the output files a short sensible name as shown.

* Now we are ready to trim the read ends to remove bases with low quality. We will use the Trimmomatic program:

```sh
At_accn=Col_0 	# Col_0 Ler_0
cpu=4
trimmomatic SE \
-threads $cpu \
-phred33 \
-trimlog ${At_accn}_R1_trimmomatic.log \
Col_0_R1_Phred33.fastq\
${At_accn}_R1_trimmomatic.fq.gz \
LEADING:1 \
TRAILING:1 \
SLIDINGWINDOW:5:18 \
MINLEN:36 \
MINLEN:36 \
> ${At_accn}_R1_trimmomatic.log 2>&1 &
```

* The output file is a compressed file with name ending ".fq.gz" which can be used as input to the STAR aligner.

<br>
**Step 3 - Align prepared reads to the reference with STAR**

* Align separately the trimmed Col\_0, then Ler\_0 reads to the Arabidopsis genome reference: 

```sh
At_accn=Col_0      # Col_0 Ler_0
STAR --runThreadN 4 \
--runMode alignReads \
--genomeDir 	[your_genome_reference_directory] \
--readFilesCommand zcat \
--readFilesIn {$At_accn}_R1_trimmomatic.fq.gz \
--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
--outSAMattrRGline ID:$At_accn SM:$At_accn \
--outFileNamePrefix ${At_accn}
```

* **Note:** We need to insert the read group information into the bam file for FreeBayes. It can be added as part of the STAR command using the outSAMattrRGline flag. It avoids having to add it manually afterwards, as we did for Practical 1.

<br>
**Step 4 - Remove duplicate reads from the bamfiles**

* It is important to remove duplicate reads before calling SNPs. We will use Samtools to do this step. It is a four step process and uses exactly the same commands used in the same steps in Practical 1.

* Run each of the commands after exchanging the asterix for the input or output file name for each sample:

```sh
samtools sort -n -o *_st_namesort.bam *.bam
```
* Add ms and MC tags to the bam records (used by the markdup command):

```sh
samtools fixmate -m *_st_namesort.bam *_st_fixmate.bam
```

* Now sort the file again by position (field 4 of the sam record) 

```sh
samtools sort -o *_st_positionsort.bam *_st_fixmate.bam
```

* Finally, we are ready to mark and remove duplicate reads:

```sh
samtools markdup -s -r *_st_positionsort.bam  *_st_rmdup.bam
```

* **Question:** From the output printed to the screen, what is the percent of duplicate reads?

<br>
**Step 5 - Merge the bam files**

* Merge the bam files for both samples. This time we do not need to use the -r flag to attach the read group information because it has already been added:

```sh
samtools merge -f merged.bam Col_0_st_rmdup.bam Ler_0_st_rmdup.bam
```


* Qickly check that the read groups are present and the SM flag contains the abbreviations for the Arabidopsis accessions:

```sh
samtools view -H Col_0_Ler_0_merged.bam
```

* Index the bam file:

```sh
samtools  index  Col_0_Ler_0_merged.bam
```

<br>
**Step 6 - Call SNPs with FreeBayes**

* Now we are ready to call SNPs. Calling SNPs on the whole genome takes quite a long time but we can restrict the analysis a particular chromosome arm with the -r flag. We are interested in chromosome 4:

```sh
module load freebayes/1.0.2
freebayes \
--fasta-reference Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa \
Col_0_Ler_0_merged.bam \
-r 4 \
> merged_chr4_ONLY.vcf &
```

<!--At1G64970 - the SNP is in an intron!!!!-->
<br>
**Step 7 - Annotate snpEFF Annotation**

* [The snpEff Manual](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html)

<br>
<br>
**UPTOHERE10.7.2018**

http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpSift.html
Mention the config file - get them to prepare it??


```sh
module load snpeff/4.1g
snpEff \
-c /var/scratch/baileyp/Practical_2_Arabidopsis_accns/snpEff/snpEff.config \
athalianaTair10 \
merged_temp.vcf
```

* need to rename the snpEff_summary.html and snpEff_genes.txt files before running snpEff agsain to avoid over-writing the previous files.

* The SNP doesn't exist. In fact there are no mutations in the coding region only upstream and donwstream SNPs

* Get them to look at the effects/consequences:
* https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/predicted_data.html#consequences 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


At the end, have list of tools you could also use
